## Detection of plant disease using classic ML algorithms

## Modeling 
The Model is trained over 7 machine learning models named : 

   •	Logistic Regression 

   •	Linear Discriminant  Analysis

   •	K Nearest  Neighbours

   •	Decision Trees

   •	Random Forest

   •	Naïve Bayes

   •	Support Vector Machine 

And the model is validated using 10 k fold cross validation technique.
